# Stored Procedure


- A stored procedure in SQL is a precompiled collection of SQL statements that can be stored in the database for later execution.
- It helps in modularizing and organizing code, improving performance, and enhancing security by controlling access to the database.

- Encapsulate Database logic and making it easier to manage and resuse the code

-- Let's create a simple stored procedure that retrieves all records from a table called Employees:

Create Procedure GetallEmployeedata
as
begin
select * from Employees
End;

-- Executing the Precedure

Exec GetallEmployeedata;

## MYSQL
