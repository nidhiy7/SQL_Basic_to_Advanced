--- In SQL, a join is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. 
--- Joins are fundamental for querying data from multiple tables simultaneously, allowing for complex data retrieval and analysis.

Types of Joins:
1) INNER JOIN:
An inner join returns rows from both tables where the join condition is met.

2) LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN):
A left join returns all rows from the left table (first table) and the matched rows from the right table (second table). 
If no match is found, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.

3) RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN):
A right join returns all rows from the right table (second table) and the matched rows from the left table (first table). 
If no match is found, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.

4) FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN):
A full join returns all rows when there is a match in either the left table or the right table.
If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the table that lacks a match.
