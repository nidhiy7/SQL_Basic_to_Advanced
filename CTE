CTE ( Common Table Expression) 

Common Table Expressions (CTEs) in SQL provide a way to create temporary result sets that can be referenced within a query.
They are particularly useful for breaking down complex queries into more manageable parts and improving query readability.

-- reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement

-- Examples
WITH AVG_SALARY AS (
SELECT AVG(Salary)  as Avg_Salary from Employees )

Select * from employees 
inner join AVG_SALARY ON Salary > Avg_Salary;

-- Example 1: Simple CTE to List Employees with Their Departments
