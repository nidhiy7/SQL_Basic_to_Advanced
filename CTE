CTE ( Common Table Expression) 

Common Table Expressions (CTEs) in SQL provide a way to create temporary result sets that can be referenced within a query.
They are particularly useful for breaking down complex queries into more manageable parts and improving query readability.

-- reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement

-- Examples
WITH AVG_SALARY AS (
SELECT AVG(Salary)  as Avg_Salary from Employees )

Select * from employees 
inner join AVG_SALARY ON Salary > Avg_Salary;

-- Example 1: Simple CTE to List Employees with Their Departments

WITH EmployeeDepartment AS (
    SELECT 
        e.EmployeeID,
        e.FirstName,
        e.LastName,
        e.Email,
        e.JobTitle,
        d.DepartmentName
    FROM 
        Employees e
    JOIN 
        Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
)
SELECT 
    EmployeeID,
    FirstName,
    LastName,
    Email,
    JobTitle,
    DepartmentName
FROM 
    EmployeeDepartment;

# Recursive CTE

A Recursive CTE is useful for querying hierarchical data. It references itself within its definition.
