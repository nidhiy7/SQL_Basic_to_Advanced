CTE ( Common Table Expression) 

Common Table Expressions (CTEs) in SQL provide a way to create temporary result sets that can be referenced within a query.
They are particularly useful for breaking down complex queries into more manageable parts and improving query readability.

-- Without cte
select * from EmployeeSalary
where salary > (select avg(salary) from EmployeeSalary);

-- With CTE

With avg_salary as(
select avg(salary) as avg_sal from EmployeeSalary
)

select * from EmployeeSalary
inner join avg_salary on Salary > avg_sal;
